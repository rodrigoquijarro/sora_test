## 1. Introduction

The following process was created to automate the provisioning of instances with one dockerized application called `<appwebtime>`, hosted in dockerhub under my profile `<mailtech/sora_test>`. to automate the provisioning and be used for developers teams with different OS, compiler/interpreter version and dependencies installed on their local computers.

## 2. Architecture

The following architecture shows the process considered to complete the task:

![Screenshot from 2021-06-23 23-31-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53281151/123164791-13506080-d47c-11eb-8e99-c85c2213fe04.png)

In the workstation a `<nodejs>` webapp is created to shows the message `<Hello World! Time is: >`, dockerized and hosted in a Dockerhub private repository, in the same local station a Jenkins' pipeline is triggered, creating a Terraform secure connection stablished with AWS CLI to create three instances, which accept interesting traffic only in ports 22 and 443, the instances are created with a Launch configuration which search the instances based on the `<ami>` and `<availability_zones>` variables declared. The EC2 instances are connected to a ELB load balancer, listening just `<https>` traffic and will launch the number of instances according to the traffic detected on port `<443>`.  

The bootstrapping process is done by Ansible, based on a local configuration which has an Ansible AWS Dynamic Inventory setup, to collect the instances  characteristics and execute the tasks declared in `<site.yaml>`

The pipeline is configured in Jenkins, firing up a job to check the repo in Github, Terraform stage with a `<apply>` and `<destroy>` parameterized building setup and Ansible task exec.

If the process fails due to connection interruptions or delays, Ansible has a retry block configuration.


## 3. Installation sora_test process

To install <sora_test>, follow these steps:

### Application
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Docker container
```
docker build . -t mailtech/appwebtime --no-cache
docker push mailtech/appwebtime
```

### Jenkins pipeline 

In the Jenkins dashboard select the option `<apply>` or `<destroy>`

## 4. Configuration

### IaC to provision an instance: Terraform

The profile used to connect AWS can be specified in the Jenkins pipeline script and will be used with the variable profile created in `<variables.tf>`. The following configuration is declared in `<main.tf>`

The `<ami>` configuration is by default as `<t2.micro>` allowing traffic just in the following ports
```  
Ingress: Port 443, 22
```

The number of instances to create is based on the autoscaling group with a size of:
```
min_size = 2
max_size = 4
```
The High Availability and Scaling is configured in `<AutoScaling Group>` with health check parameters that waits for 5 mins until the instances are declared as `<stable>`
```
health_check_grace_period = 600
health_check_type = "ELB"
```

The ELB configuration main points are, the counters to declare an instances as `<healthy>` or `<unhealthy>`, traffic and traffic kind.
```
health_check {
    healthy_threshold = 2
    unhealthy_threshold = 2
    timeout = 3
    interval = 30
    target = "HTTP:443/"

listener {
    lb_port = 443
    lb_protocol = "http"
    instance_port = "443"
    instance_protocol = "https"
```
At the end of the Terrafor deplyment also, two values will be provided, `<aws_instance.web.*.public_ip>`, `<aws_elb.timeisweb.dns_name>` to have a confirmation of the site availability without Jenkins intervention.

### Automate the bootstrapping of the application: Ansible 

The bootstraping procees is configured by Ansible, for our case Ansible collects a dynamic inventory on AWS using `<boto>` and the `<AWS-ec2>` Ansible plugin. These configuration need to be setup locally in `</etc/ansible/inventory>`

```
plugin: aws_ec2
boto_profile: 
strict: False
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags
    prefix: tag
  - prefix: instance_type
    key: instance_type
  - key: placement.region
    prefix: aws_region
```
The config allow us to specify the group we want to perform the Ansible task execution,

wich deploy a `<pip3>` , `<python docker sdk>` , `<docker.io>` , `<service status>` and `<Run image>` executions.

### Deployment pipelines: Jenkins

The Jenkins deployment help us to trak a deployment monitoring status, loging and metrics. Backups configurations are stored in Github
to track versions, logging and metrics. The detailed console output can be verified in Appends.

## 5. Test Pipeline

The pipeline process is described as follows:

* Chckout process with Git repository.
* Terraform deployment.
* Ansible task execution.

### * Security considerations

* Version control
* Remote storing state
* No secrets storing
* AMI-AWS for Terraform authentication
* Jenkins profiles executors
* Self-signed cert for testing purposes
